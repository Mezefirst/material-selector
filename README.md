# Material Selector AI Backend Scaffold
## material-selector 
-Sustainable solution
## Features

- FastAPI backend for material recommendation
- Rule-based and ML-based material selection
- Natural language query parsing (OpenAI/Hugging Face ready)
- Simulation of performance trade-offs
- RL integration stub for future development

## Endpoints

- **/recommend**: Recommend materials (supports structured and NLP queries)
- **/alternatives**: Suggest alternative materials
- **/tradeoff**: Simulate trade-offs between materials
- **/plan_rl**: Placeholder for RL-driven recommendations

## How to Extend

- Connect to your actual database for real data
- Enhance `services/nlp.py` with real NLP model or API
- Expand `services/recommender.py` with production logic
- Implement RL in `services/rl_stub.py` when ready
